# C-two-stack
Two stack usage in C++
Question: In this homework you are expected to develop a simple version of the web browsers’ 
“Go back one page”, and “Go forward one page” functionality utilizing two stacks. These two 
stacks will be called as backward_stack and forward_stack. They will keep the web addresses 
that you visited previously. 
In the application you will generate a menu as displayed in the sample run and allow user to select 
following functionalities; “visit new webpage”, “go back one page”, “go forward one page”.
Do not forget that the webpage you currently are in may not have a previous page or a forward 
page. If that is the case, you must give appropriate error messages. Check the sample output 
thoroughly to understand the application functionality.
